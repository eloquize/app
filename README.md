# Introducing Eloquize

Originally built as part of the [TechTogether Seattle](https://seattle.techtogether.io/) January 2021 hackathon! <br />

Eloquize empowers users to better prepare for behavioral interviews:
* Store custom interview questions you want to practice, or draw from our library of popular questions
* Highlight key 'power words' or phrases you aim to include in your answer
* Record yourself answering each question, tracking your time and power word achievements
* Track your growth and identify goals and metrics along the way

Eloquize is a work-in-progress! Stay turned as we build out additional features and functionality. <br />
